					<h1>Who is Telling the Truth</h1>
					<p><b>Written by Tom Fowler</b><br>
					Terry Brennan was enjoying a glass of wine before dinner with his wife of over 30 years, Rochelle. The early June evening was perfect and, as they relaxed on the spacious outside patio deck, he was explaining to her how much he had enjoyed finding several long lost friends on one of the internet’s many social networking sites. 

					Terry poured another glass of wine. He was in a playful mood. “Well, there is much to tell, but since we are relaxed and in no hurry this evening, allow me to relate some of the emails they have sent me. See if you can figure out which one is telling the whole truth. Four of the five old friends I have mentioned have told me some things that, simply put, cannot be 100% accurate.” There was a twinkle in her husband’s eye. Rochelle knew that whatever Terry was about to say, it would be good. She said, “I’m not certain what you are getting at, but start talking.” </p>

					<h1>Ask Martha - The Identity Thief</h1>
					<p><b>Written by Robbie Cutler</b><br>Crusher Davis read the letter closely. It was to Ask Martha, his pen name for the personal advice column he wrote for the Chronicle. This letter was different. The writer had not only signed her real name - she accused one of her friends of identity theft! She asked Marta for help in deducing just which one had stolen her credit card. It was a challenge that Crusher Davis enjoyed.</p>

						<h1>Who Shot Mom?</h1>
						<p><b>Written by Barney Parmington</b><br>
						As I look back on my youth, I fondly remember our family’s Saturday night ritual. Of course, over the years, most of these nights tend to run together – every Saturday was the same. Except for one particular night, that is – a night that stands all alone in my memory. After all, it was the night that Mom was shot. She certainly was not hurt, but if she reads this story and figures out which of her son’s shot her, that son might not be getting much in the way of Christmas presents this year. Confused? You should be. Let me start at the beginning.</p>

						<h1>School Trip</h1>
						<p><b>Written by Bob Emmerson</b><br>
						It was a cold January night. School had just resumed and Mr. Michaels way giving his students a present was a night trip up north. This trip had been planned and finalized and only about half the class (15 students) would be attending. Mr. Michaels also invited one of his colleagues and the assistant teacher Mrs. Veronica. The students attending were thrilled and had been waiting ever since the Christmas break.</p>
